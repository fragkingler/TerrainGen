# ProcGen3D_OOP_Blocks
 
Initially I created a 2D Terrain that's minecraft-like. Afterwards I was inspired by M.Theiselmann to create it as 3D-Terrain. For this I created this sketch in which I was initially planning to random-generate a surface on a cube-like world which I can change on keypress.
Since I wanted to approach everything a bit more naturally and this approach looked very random, I decided to ditch it and go at it from a different perspective. This project is abandoned and is superseeded by the final TerrainGen sketch.
