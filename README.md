# TerrainGen
 
3D Terrain Generation inspired by minecraft. I've experimented with a lot of techniques as seen in other repos. Also I tried the text-buffering, real-cloud generation and drawing animated water that's adjusting to terrain.

Slow clouds down and teleport them a bit away from camera: ARROW_UP
Pause/Unpause the program: SPACEBAR
